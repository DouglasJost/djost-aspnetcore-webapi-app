# djost-aspnetcore-webapi-app
ASP.NET Core WebAPI application that I created.  Chose to not use top-level statements.  I wanted to keep "public static void Main(string[] args)" in my Program.cs file.  And, chose to use controllers.  And, disabled ImplicitUsing, to require class files to include using statements.  See README.md for more details.
